            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the Hartford Fire Departmentâ€™s web page. Our department consists of a full-time Fire Chief,
                part-time Assistant Chief and a dedicated group of men and women that serve our community.
                <br>
                We currently have a roster of 16 members and 2 cadet students. Our department services 35 square miles
                of the City of Hartford & Hartford Township including about a 6 mile stretch of Interstate 94, as well
                as a portion of Bangor Township.
                <br>
                Our department has strong relationships with our neighboring communities with Automatic Aid agreements
                in place with Lawrence, Watervliet, and Keeler Fire Departments. The Hartford Fire Department answers
                about 700 calls per year.
                <br>
                Calls range from fires, automobile accidents, smoke and odor investigations, carbon monoxide alarms and
                false alarms. The majority of calls are EMS related. We run a Medical First Response service working
                closely with our EMS Provider, Pride Care Ambulance Service.
                <br>
                On behalf of the members of the department, thank you for visiting our web page.
